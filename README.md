# D2WLB
**Destiny 2 Weapon Leaderboard Bot**    
Made with ðŸ’™ by Chase Borchers  

## Getting started
This README will guide you on installing dependencies, modifying the `.env` file, and obtaining all environment variable data from [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/), [bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny), and the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You will also be guided on the Discord bot creation process and its functionality within Discord and the terminal.

## Dependencies
This project uses the latest dependency versions from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). Execute the following commands to install the latest dependencies required.

**Change directory to the parent directory** - `cd path/to/D2WLB`

**Install dependencies** - `npm install`

**Update dependencies** - `npm update`

## Environment variables
This project uses a `.env` file to store API keys and passwords. **DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE WITH OTHERS!**

### Modify `.env` file
Rename `template.env` to `.env` and obtain the actual values from the next section.

## Obtain keys and passwords for `.env` file

### `SMARTPROXY_USERNAME` & `SMARTPROXY_PASSWORD`
The bot needs rotating proxies to bypass rate limiting restrictions from [Charlemagne](https://warmind.io/crucible).  
Without this, two or more users triggering slash commands within a short period of time will break the bot.  

[Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/) is the cheapest reliable solution to bypassing web scraping restrictions found thus far.
